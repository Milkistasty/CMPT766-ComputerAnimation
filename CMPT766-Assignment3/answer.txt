Part 4: Parameters Tuning

Best values I found:
Dt: 0.0001
Mass: 1
Ks: 1500
Kd: 20
Mu: 1


Dt (Time Step): A small time step increases simulation accuracy, particularly for detecting and responding to collisions, so I just make it as small as possible but keeping the animation looks smooth. And I found this value 0.0001 worked the best, if value smaller than this, the animation of the write dice will look much slower than the yellow dice.

Mass: Higher mass makes the dice fall faster and resist changes in motion more during collisions. But in order to get the similar motions as the yellow dice's, I didn't change this one.

Ks (Spring Constant): Controls the repulsive force when penetrating the ground. Higher values reduce penetration depth, causing firmer bounces. For this one, I just try different values, and I found when Ks = 1500, the white dice has the most similar motions as the yellow dice's, that's why I chose this value.

Kd (Damping Constant): Damps velocity on impact to prevent excessive bouncing. Higher values make landings smoother. Reasoning for this is similar to Ks, I just tried different values, and 20 worked the best.

Mu (Friction Coefficient): Adds friction to prevent sliding and promotes rolling. Higher values reduce sliding, enhancing realism. Same reason as Ks and Kd.
